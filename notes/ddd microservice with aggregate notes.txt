1 service = 1 database
1 transaction = 1 aggregate update

were about to break the ACID transaction
avoid 2PC (2 phase commit)
save the event to event store to re-create the data

each command must return an event
each event may or may not return a command

...
let say we need to fetch the item stock in a concurrent user sessions

on confirmation event, we will use the data version before persisting the record
if the version did not match, we will run a re-check for the newest event that happened
we update the record in database iff there is no rules broken by the newest event
emit the integration event to update the data version
