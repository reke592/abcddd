create a handler
create a command
    add aggregate id as result

api:
    run the command
    redirect the action result to a GET query with the aggregate id in command.result

in terms of AQMP
    create basic prop for correlation id in producer
    on each consumer, use the correlation id when propagating the request to other services
    return the correlation id in producer command
    redirect the user to an endpoint, supplying the correlation id to get the result
