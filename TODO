create marker interface for errored events for realtime projections

optimize aggregate loading:
  include aggregate version to commands

complete application layer projections
  active record setters MUST be internal

create test
  employees:
    on leave
    separated

-----------------------------------
CASE: having 2 same micro-service instance running in different event versions.
TODO: create anti-corruption layer for different event version in aggregate event stream:
  50%   application layer projections
        ... need more clarifications
  0%    domain logic 
        ... pretty hard to picture,
        ... what if the updates is for security meassures in domain aggregate,
        ... do we permit the old version on committing actions?
        ... how about,
        ... we avoid running an outdated microservice, no need to create a compatibility layer. :P

optimize YAMLSerializationTest
- remove monolithic test case

* finish creating command and events
